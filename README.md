# Rescuable
Render an error in the right way.

## Installation

Include to your Gemfile
```ruby
gem 'rescuable', '~> 0.1.0'
```

Or install directly in your terminal
```bash
gem install rescuable
```

## Usage

### Ruby integration
The installation automatically includes the controller renderer helpers.

### Manually integration
If you're not using Ruby on Rails, that's not a problem at all. You just have to include the helper in your controller/renderer class like that:

```ruby
include Rescuable::Helpers::RendererController
```
